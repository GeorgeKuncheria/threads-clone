# Project Overview

The "threads-clone" project aims to replicate some of the features of a chat application, allowing users to communicate with each other in real-time. It leverages various technologies to achieve this, including React for the frontend, Express.js and Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Chat**: Users can send and receive messages in real-time, enabling instant communication.
- **User Authentication**: The application likely includes user authentication functionality to ensure that only registered users can access the chat features.
- **Message Persistence**: Messages are likely stored in a MongoDB database to provide persistence, allowing users to view past messages even after logging out or refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend is likely designed to be responsive, ensuring that users can access the chat application from various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for creating the frontend of the application.
- **Express.js & Node.js**: Backend frameworks used for creating the server-side logic and handling API requests.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing chat messages and user data.
- **Socket.IO**: A library for enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers, likely used for implementing the real-time chat functionality.
